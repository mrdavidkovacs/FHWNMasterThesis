abstract = {"Statistical natural-language processing is, in my estimation, one of the most fast-moving and exciting areas of computer science these days. Anyone who wants to learn this field would be well advised to get this book. For that matter, the same goes for anyone who is already in the field. I know that it is going to be one of the most well-thumbed books on my bookshelf." - Eugene Charniak, Department of Computer Science, Brown University Statistical approaches to processing natural language text have become dominant in recent years. This foundational text is the first comprehensive introduction to statistical natural language processing (NLP) to appear. The book contains all the theory and algorithms needed for building NLP tools. It provides broad but rigorous coverage of mathematical and linguistic foundations, as well as detailed discussion of statistical methods, allowing students and researchers to construct their own implementations. The book covers collocation finding, word sense disambiguation, probabilistic parsing, information retrieval, and other applications. More on this book},

Moreover, we leverage sources of noisy labels as our training data. These noisy labels were provided by a few sentiment detection websites over twitter data. In our experi-ments, we show that since our features are able to capture a more abstract represen-tation of tweets, our solution is more ef-fective than previous ones and also more robust regarding biased and noisy data, which is the kind of data provided by these sources.},

abstract = {Oil/water partition coefficient (log P) is one of the key points for lead compound to be drug. In silico log P models based solely on chemical structures have become an important part of modern drug discovery. Here, we report support vector machines, radial basis function neural networks, and multiple linear regression methods to investigate the correlation between partition coefficient and physico-chemical descriptors for a large data set of compounds. The correlation coefficient r (2) between experimental and predicted log P for training and test sets by support vector machines, radial basis function neural networks, and multiple linear regression is 0.92, 0.90, and 0.88, respectively. The results show that non-linear support vector machines derives statistical models that have better prediction ability than those of radial basis function neural networks and multiple linear regression methods. This indicates that support vector machines can be used as an alternative modeling tool for quantitative structure-property/activity relationships studies.},

Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, off-the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SV M light1 is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for SV M light V2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains.},

abstract = {We study the problem of correlating micro-blogging activity with stock-market events, defined as changes in the price and traded volume of stocks. Specifically, we collect messages related to a number of companies, and we search for correlations between stock-market events for those companies and features extracted from the micro-blogging messages. The features we extract can be categorized in two groups. Features in the first group measure the overall activity in the micro-blogging platform, such as number of posts, number of re-posts, and so on. Features in the second group measure properties of an induced interaction graph, for instance, the number of connected components, statistics on the degree distribution, and other graph-based properties. We present detailed experimental results measuring the correlation of the stock market events with these features, using Twitter as a data source. Our results show that the most correlated features are the number of connected components and the number of nodes of the interaction graph. The correlation is stronger with the traded volume than with the price of the stock. However, by using a simulator we show that even relatively small correlations between price and micro-blogging features can be exploited to drive a stock trading strategy that outperforms other baseline strategies.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of social networks has produced an unprecedented amount of user-generated data, which provides an excellent opportunity for text mining. Sentiment analysis, an important part of text mining, attempts to learn about the authors' opinion on a text through its content and structure. Such information is particularly valuable for determining the overall opinion of a large number of people. Examples of the usefulness of this are predicting box office sales or stock prices. One of the most accessible sources of user-generated data is Twitter, which makes the majority of its user data freely available through its data access API. In this study we seek to predict a sentiment value for stock related tweets on Twitter, and demonstrate a correlation between this sentiment and the movement of a company's stock price in a real time streaming environment. Both n-gram and “word2vec” textual representation techniques are used alongside a random forest classification algorithm to predict the sentiment of tweets. These values are then evaluated for correlation between stock prices and Twitter sentiment for that each company. There are significant correlations between price and sentiment for several individual companies. Some companies such as Microsoft and Walmart show strong positive correlation, while others such as Goldman Sachs and Cisco Systems show strong negative correlation. This suggests that consumer facing companies are affected differently than other companies. Overall this appears to be a promising field for future research.},

Developing a program for sentiment analysis is an approach to be used to computationally measure customers' perceptions. This paper reports on the design of a sentiment analysis, extracting a vast amount of tweets. Prototyping is used in this development. Results classify customers' perspective via tweets into positive and negative, which is represented in a pie chart and html page.

The intellectual dominance of the efficient-market revolution has more been challenged by economists who stress psychological and behavioral elements of stock-price determination and by econometricians who argue that stock returns are, to a considerable extent, predictable. This survey examines the attacks on the efficient-market hypothesis and the relationship between predictability and efficiency. I conclude that our stock markets are more efficient and less predictable than many recent academic papers would have us believe.},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce Digital Methods Initiative Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset, a toolset for capturing and analyzing Twitter data. Instead of just presenting a technical paper detailing the system, however, the authors argue that the type of data used for, as well as the methods encoded in, computational systems have epistemological repercussions for research. The authors thus aim at situating the development of the toolset in relation to methodological debates in the social sciences and humanities. Design/methodology/approach – The authors review the possibilities and limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data in order to address the various ways in which computational systems frame research. The authors then introduce the open-source toolset and put forward an approach that embraces methodological diversity and epistemological plurality. Findings – The authors find that design decisions and more general methodological reasoning can and should go hand in hand when building tools for computational social science or digital humanities. Practical implications – Besides methodological transparency, the software provides robust and reproducible data capture and analysis, and interlinks with existing analytical software. Epistemic plurality is emphasized by taking into account how Twitter structures information, by allowing for a number of different sampling techniques, by enabling a variety of analytical approaches or paradigms, and by facilitating work at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Originality/value – The paper opens up critical debate by connecting tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its repercussions for the production of knowledge. The design of the software is inspired by exchanges and debates with scholars from a variety of disciplines and the attempt to propose a flexible and extensible tool that accommodates a wide array of methodological approaches is directly motivated by the desire to keep computational work open for various epistemic sensibilities.},

Major challenge in this area is to tame the data in terms of noise, relevance, emoticons, folksonomies and slangs. This works is an effort to see the effect of pre-processing on twitter data for the fortification of sentiment classification especially in terms of slang word. The proposed method of pre-processing relies on the bindings of slang words on other coexisting words to check the significance and sentiment translation of the slang word. We have used n-gram to find the bindings and conditional random fields to check the significance of slang word. Experiments were carried out to observe the effect of proposed method on sentiment classification which clearly indicates the improvements in accuracy of classification.},

abstract = {Financial news articles are believed to have impacts on stock price return. Previous works model news pieces in bag-of-words space, which analyzes the latent relationship between word statistical patterns and stock price movements. However, news sentiment, which is an important ring on the chain of mapping from the word patterns to the price movements, is rarely touched. In this paper, we first implement a generic stock price prediction framework, and plug in six different models with different analyzing approaches. To take one step further, we use Harvard psychological dictionary and Loughran-McDonald financial sentiment dictionary to construct a sentiment space. Textual news articles are then quantitatively measured and projected onto the sentiment space. Instance labeling method is rigorously discussed and tested. We evaluate the models' prediction accuracy and empirically compare their performance at different market classification levels. Experiments are conducted on five years historical Hong Kong Stock Exchange prices and news articles. Results show that (1) at individual stock, sector and index levels, the models with sentiment analysis outperform the bag-of-words model in both validation set and independent testing set; (2) the models which use sentiment polarity cannot provide useful predictions; (3) there is a minor difference between the models using two different sentiment dictionaries.},

abstract = {No clear consensual definition regarding frailty seems to emerge from the literature after 30 years of research in the topic, and a large array of models and criteria has been proposed to define the syndrome. Controversy continues to exist on the choice of the components to be included in the frailty definition. Two main definitions based on clusters of components are found in literature: a physical phenotype of frailty, operationalized in 2001 by providing a list of 5 measurable items of functional impairments, which coexists with a multidomain phenotype, based on a frailty index constructed on the accumulation of identified deficits based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. The physical phenotype considers disability and comorbidities such as dementia as distinct entities and therefore outcomes of the frailty syndrome, whereas comorbidity and disability can be components of the multidomain phenotype. Expanded models of physical frailty (models that included clusters other than the original 5 items such as dementia) increased considerably the predicting capacity of poor clinical outcomes when compared with the predictive capacity of the physical phenotype. The unresolved controversy of the components shapes the clusters of original frailty syndrome, and the components depend very much on how frailty is defined. This update also highlights the growing evidence on gait speed to be considered as a single-item frailty screening tool. The evaluation of gait speed over a short distance emerges from the literature as a tool with the capacity to identify frail older adults, and slow gait speed has been proven to be a strong predictor for frailty-adverse outcomes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Neural networks have been shown to be a promising tool for forecasting financial time series. Several design factors significantly impact the accuracy of neural network forecasts. These factors include selection of input variables, architecture of the network, and quantity of training data. The questions of input variable selection and system architecture design have been widely researched, but the corresponding question of how much information to use in producing high-quality neural network models has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, the effects of different sizes of training sample sets on forecasting currency exchange rates are examined. It is shown that those neural networks—given an appropriate amount of historical knowledge—can forecast future currency exchange rates with 60 percent accuracy, while those neural networks trained on a larger training set have a worse forecasting performance. In addition to higher-quality forecasts, the reduced training set sizes reduce development cost and time.},

This is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or companies that want to monitor the public sentiment of their brands. There is no previous research on classifying sentiment of messages on microblogging services like Twitter. We present the results of machine learning algorithms for classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages using distant supervision. Our training data consists of Twitter messages with emoticons, which are used as noisy labels. This type of training data is abundantly available and can be obtained through automated means. We show that machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and SVM) have accuracy above 80{\%} when trained with emoticon data. This paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed in order to achieve high accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is the idea of using tweets with emoticons for distant supervised learning.},

abstract = {Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest. Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events. Especially, twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on twitter has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets.},

In this paper, we used the sentiment analysis of top leading cloud service providers namely; Amazon and Microsoft Azure to analyse their customers' opinions and reviews. To do that, two datasets are extracted which are consisting of tweets that had either organizations' names or cloud names. We study, and analyze the way customers think about them. In this regard, many organizations tend to find out what do customers think or tweet about their products in order to effectively plan marketing campaigns and try to gain the positive impact of Word-of-Mouth. Results are analyzed and explained in details in term of polarity and emotions classifications to show the impact of sentiment analysis to support organizations decisions. We can note from the emotions classification results that, 'joy' category is better for Microsoft Azure comparing to Amazon, The 'sadness' percentage is larger for Amazon comparing to Microsoft Azure. Furthermore, we can note from the polarity classification that Microsoft Azure has 65{\%} positive tweets compared 45{\%} for Amazon. In addition, the results show that Amazon has 50{\%} negative polarity compared 25{\%} for Microsoft Azure. {\&}copy; 2016 IEEE.},

Moreover, PolArt is able to cope with the target-specific polarity of phrases, where two neutral words combine to a non-neutral phrase. Target detection is done with the Wikipedia category system, but also user defined target hierarchies are allowed. PolArt is based on the TreeTagger chunker output, and is customised for English and German. In this paper we evaluate PolArt's compositional capacity.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers organisations and individuals a fast and effective way to monitor the publics' feelings towards them and their competitors. To assess the performance of sentiment analysis methods over Twitter a small set of evaluation datasets have been released in the last few years. In this paper we present an overview of eight publicly available and manually annotated evaluation datasets for Twitter sentiment analysis. Based on this review, we show that a common limitation of most of these datasets, when assessing sentiment analysis at target (entity) level, is the lack of distinctive sentiment annotations among the tweets and the entities contained in them. For example, the tweet “I love iPhone, but I hate iPad” can be annotated with a mixed sentiment label, but the entity iPhone within this tweet should be annotated with a positive sentiment label. Aiming to overcome this limitation, and to complement current evaluation datasets, we present STS-Gold, a new evaluation dataset where tweets and targets (entities) are annotated individually and therefore may present different sentiment labels. This paper also provides a comparative study of the various datasets along several dimensions including: total number of tweets, vocabulary size and sparsity. We also investigate the pair-wise correlation among these dimensions as well as their correlations to the sentiment classification performance on different datasets.},

We have analyzed sentiments for more than 4 million tweets between June 2010 to July 2011 for DJIA, NASDAQ-100 and 13 other big cap technological stocks. Our results show high correlation (upto 0.88 for returns) between stock prices and twitter sentiments. Further, using Granger's Causality Analysis, we have validated that the movement of stock prices and indices are greatly affected in the short term by Twitter discussions. Finally, we have implemented Expert Model Mining System (EMMS) to demonstrate that our forecasted returns give a high value of R-square (0.952) with low Maximum Absolute Percentage Error (MaxAPE) of 1.76{\%} for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).},

abstract = {Sarcasm is a type of sentiment where people express their negative feelings using positive or intensified positive words in the text. While speaking, people often use heavy tonal stress and certain gestural clues like rolling of the eyes, hand movement, etc. to reveal sarcastic. In the textual data, these tonal and gestural clues are missing, making sarcasm detection very difficult for an average human. Due to these challenges, researchers show interest in sarcasm detection of social media text, especially in tweets. Rapid growth of tweets in volume and its analysis pose major challenges. In this paper, we proposed a Hadoop based framework that captures real time tweets and processes it with a set of algorithms which identifies sarcastic sentiment effectively. We observe that the elapse time for analyzing and processing under Hadoop based framework significantly outperforms the conventional methods and is more suited for real time streaming tweets.},

One difficulty in handling some classes of documents is the presence of different kinds of textual errors, such as spelling and grammatical errors in email, and character recognition errors in documents that come through OCR. Text categorization must work reliably on all input, and thus must tolerate some level of these kinds of problems. We describe here an N-gram-based approach to text categorization that is tolerant of textual errors. The system is small, fast and robust. This system worked very well for language classification, achieving in one test a 99.8{\%} correct classification rate on Usenet newsgroup articles written in different languages. The system also worked reasonably well for classifying articles from a number of different computer-oriented newsgroups according to subject, achieving as high as an 80{\%} correct classification...},

We found that emotional tweet percentage significantly negatively correlated with Dow Jones, NASDAQ and S{\&}P 500, but displayed significant positive correlation to VIX. It therefore seems that just checking on twitter for emotional outbursts of any kind gives a predictor of how the stock market will be doing the next day.},

abstract = {— Machine learning is the essence of artificial intelligence. Machine Learning learns from past experiences to improve the performances of intelligent programs. Machine learning system builds the learning model that effectively " learns " how to estimate from training data of given example. IT refers to a set of topics dealing with the creation and evaluation of algorithms that facilitate pattern recognition, classification, and prediction, based on models derived from existing data. In this new era, Machine learning is mostly in use to demonstrate the promise of producing consistently accurate estimates. The main goal and contribution of this review paper is to present the overview of machine learning and provides machine-learning techniques. Also paper reviews the merits and demerits of various machine learning algorithms in different approaches. I. INTRODUCTION Machine learning is multidisplinary field in artificial intelligence, probability, statistics, information theory, philosophy, psychology, and neurobiology. Machine learning solves the real world problems by building a model that is good and useful approximation to the data. The study of Machine learning has grown from the efforts of exploring whether computers could learn to mimic the human brain, and a field of statistics to a broad discipline that has produced fundamental statistical computational theories of learning processes. In 1946 the first computer system ENIAC was developed. The idea at that time was that human thinking and learning could be rendered logically in such a machine. In 1950 Alan Turing proposed a test to measure its performance. The Turing test is based on the idea that we can only determine if a machine can actually learn if we communicate with it and cannot distinguish it from another human. Around 1952 Arthur Samuel (IBM) wrote the first game-playing program, for checkers, to achieve sufficient skill to challenge a world champion. In 1957 Frank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron which connects a web of points where simple decisions are made that come together in the larger program to solve more complex problems. In 1967, pattern recognition is developed when first program able to recognize patterns were designed based on the type of algorithm called the nearest neighbor. In 1981, Gerold Dejong introduced explanation based learning where prior knowledge of the world is provided by training examples which makes the use of supervised learning. In the early 90's machine learning became very popular again due to the intersection of Compter Science and Statistics.},

Automatic detection of sarcasm in microblogs, such as - Twitter, is a difficult task. It requires a system that can use some knowledge to interpret the linguistic styles of authors. In this work, we try to provide this knowledge to the system by considering different sets of features which are relatively independent of the text, namely - function words and part of speech n-grams. We test a range of different feature sets using the Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and fuzzy clustering algorithms. Our results show that the sarcasm detection task benefits from the inclusion of features which capture authorial style of the microblog authors.

These reviews and blogs may be classified into different polarity groups such as positive, negative, and neutral in order to extract information from the input dataset. Supervised machine learning methods help to classify these reviews. In this paper, four different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy (ME), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been considered for classification of human sentiments.

abstract = {Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7{\%} in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We show how weighting the forum posts of the contributors according to their network position allow us to predict trends and real world events in the movie business. To test our approach we conducted two experiments analyzing online forum discussions on the Internet movie database (IMDb) by examining the correlation of the social network structure with external metrics such as box office revenue and Oscar Awards. We find that discussion patterns on IMDb predict Academy Awards nominations and box office success. Two months before the Oscars were given we were able to correctly predict nine Oscar nominations. We also found that forum contributions correlated with box office success of 20 top grossing movies of 2006.},

abstract = {Our emotional state influences our choices. Research on how it happens usually comes from the lab. We know rela- tively little about how real world emotions affect real world settings, like financial markets. Here, we demonstrate that estimating emotions from weblogs provides novel informa- tion about future stock market prices. That is, it provides information not already apparent from market data. Specifi- cally, we estimate anxiety, worry and fear from a dataset of over 20 million posts made on the site LiveJournal. Using a Granger-causal framework, we find that increases in expres- sions of anxiety, evidenced by computationally-identified linguistic features, predict downward pressure on the S{\&}P 500 index. We also present a confirmation of this result via Monte Carlo simulation. The findings show how the mood of millions in a large online community, even one that pri- marily discusses daily life, can anticipate changes in a seem- ingly unrelated system. Beyond this, the results suggest new ways to gauge public opinion and predict its impact.},

abstract = {Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity (also called semantic orientation). However, the contextual polarity of the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the word's prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or vice versa. Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of this work is to automatically distinguish between prior and contextual polarity, with a focus on understanding which features are important for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is identifying when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for distinguishing between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all learning algorithms except one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance. Another facet of the evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of features for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity. These experiments show that the presence of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system's ability to identify when an instance is neutral.},

Here, by incorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify happiness levels on a continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and lyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent, improvable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond approaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we find that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960s to the mid 1990s while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of blogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and fall with blogger age and distance from the Earth's equator.},

Therefore microblogging web-sites are rich sources of data for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Because microblogging has appeared relatively recently, there are a few research works that were devoted to this topic. In our paper, we focus on using Twitter, the most popular microblogging platform, for the task of sentiment analysis. We show how to automatically collect a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinionmining purposes. We performlinguistic analysis of the collected corpus and explain discovered phenomena. Using the corpus, we build a sentiment classifier, that is able to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments for a document. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed techniques are efficient and performs better than previously proposed methods. In our research, we worked with English, however, the proposed technique can be used with any other language. 1.},

In this paper, positive sentiment probability is proposed as a new indicator to be used in predictive sentiment analysis in finance. By using the Granger causality test we show that sentiment polarity (positive and negative sentiment) can indicate stock price movements a few days in advance. Finally, we adapted the Support Vector Machine classification mechanism to categorize tweets into three sentiment categories (positive, negative and neutral), resulting in improved predictive power of the classifier in the stock market application.},

With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.},

A discussion of two common approaches to predicting stock prices—the chartist (or technical) theories and the theory of fundamental (or intrinsic) value—allows the reader to put the theory of random walks into perspective. The theory of the market as efficient (at least semistrong efficient) and characterized as a random walk states that successive price changes in individual securities are independent and a series of stock price changes has no memory; thus, the past history of the series cannot be used to predict the future history. Empirical evidence indicates that, although price changes may not be strictly independent, the dependence is so slight that a simple buy-and-hold strategy beats any strategy based on mechanical trading rules. The implications of the market being a random walk are devastating for chartism. For fundamental value analysis, the im...},
