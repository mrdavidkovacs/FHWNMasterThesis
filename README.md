# MasterThesis
This repository contains my master thesis and the presentation.
Please see the corresponding files.
 * thesis.tex
 * presentation.tex

Furthermore, the repository performs CI and saves the artifacts as releases.

It is still work in progress.

## Build Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mrdavidkovacs/MasterThesis.svg?token=DztjHfzimT8t5amFoWvk&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mrdavidkovacs/MasterThesis)

## Issues
One thing which won't work is the glossary (list of acronyms) for the thesis.pdf.

# Thesis template for FHWN (FH Wiener Neustadt, University of Applied Sciences in Wiener Neustadt)
The most important styles are extracted to a new LaTeX class (see includes/fhwn-masterthesis.cls)

Some thesis specific functions/variables are extracted to 
* includes/masterthesis-definitions.sty
* includes/masterthesis-vars.sty

Furthermore, this repository includes the font "TW Cen MT".
